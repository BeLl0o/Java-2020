In the note, I should describe you work as clear as possible, for example, for the `abstract` , you could write:

```
Abstract: keyword, use to decorate a class, which exist some methods will be implemented by sub-class.
Usage: (1) abstract public class XX {}
(2) abstract void setXX(); // not {}, only declaration
Notice: (1) if a class derived from a abstract class, it should implement all the abstract methods or itself should be abstract class.
(2) ...
(3) ...

instead of:
Today, I learned abstract keyword
```
